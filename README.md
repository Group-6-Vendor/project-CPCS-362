Description:
This program demo is meant to show how we can improve the modern vending machine for both the customer, restocker and the managers.

#How-To-Run

Download the executeable in the Release tab. Place the program into a folder. The program will need to create files on the computer in order to function, so a folder is the best location to put it in. The program will only create .txt files, but windows will flag this program as malware. This is due to the fact that I am not able to sign the program.
