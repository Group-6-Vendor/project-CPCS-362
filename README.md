#This will be used for coding on Project

#Our main goal is to build and code a working demo for a vending machine. Remember, that the user, worker, and employer are all consumers of this product. Everyone's satisfaction **MUST BE MET**

A vending-machine upgrade. Customer, Employer and worker satisfaction must be met with no compromise or risks involved to any party's expense. This is still a work-in-progress project. 
#written either in C++ or python

This code may/not be written in one or more languages, but this program should read from a file "expiration_tracker.txt" for any data related to the item's "name,expireDate (2xxx-MM-DD),SlotNumber".

Future releases will/should accommodate these changes
